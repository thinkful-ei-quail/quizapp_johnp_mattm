/**
 *
 * Technical requirements:
 *
 * Your app should include a render() function, that regenerates the view each time the store is updated.
 * See your course material, consult your instructor, and reference the slides for more details.
 *
 * NO additional HTML elements should be added to the index.html file.
 *
 * You may add attributes (classes, ids, etc) to the existing HTML elements, or link stylesheets or additional scripts if necessary
 *
 * SEE BELOW FOR THE CATEGORIES OF THE TYPES OF FUNCTIONS YOU WILL BE CREATING ðŸ‘‡
 *

/********** TEMPLATE GENERATION FUNCTIONS **********/


//Mark Up Generator Functions -JP
//these will generate html to be injected into index.html using the .html() function in jquery -JP


// These functions return HTML templates

/********** RENDER FUNCTION(S) **********/


// these should  call the generator functions and be called by event handlers-JP


  // This function conditionally replaces the contents of the <main> tag based on the state of the store

/********** EVENT HANDLER FUNCTIONS **********/


//these will call different generator functions for events including opening the page overall-JP


  // These functions handle events (submit, click, etc)


  //examples function handleSubmitAnswer(), function handleWrongAnswer(), function handleCorrectAnswer(), function handleClickAnswer() -JP


  //call the start function-JP
